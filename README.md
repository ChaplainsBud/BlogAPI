I want to avoid gluttony, lust, gluttony,  anger, envy, sloth, and pride:

a. Eat simple: no need for foodie adventures
b. Marry with a simple heart: no blown-out expectations
c. Shelter self with simplicity -> minimalism
d. Solve problems with creativity and perseverance, not impatience and a lack of self-control
e. Admire others and learn from them; play the game of life, and accept your losses along with wins
f. Love others the way you love yourself, never at the exclusion of others -- like dialogue vs. monologue
g. Ambitiously improve your estate so that you can care for your own without begging, and have enough to
expand your love to strangers, hospitality. Xenophilia.
